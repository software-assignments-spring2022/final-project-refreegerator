## Wireframes
### Wireframe 1: Home screen with Login Prompt

This is the initial page a user will see when accessing our app. It will prompt the user to login, or create an account.

If the user has a valid login, they will be redirected to the item page, and if they don't they will be directed toward the create account page.
