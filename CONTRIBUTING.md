# Contributing to Refreegerator
We welcome all contributions! There are plenty of ways to contribute:
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing or adding new features
- Becoming a maintainer



# Team Norms
## Team Values
- while working individually, you are expected to put in full time and effort to ensure an equal workload and contribution
- if anything is unclear, ask the team for help (as they might know a quick fix) before asking TAs
- if certain tasks are new and difficult, team members may work together (pair programming)
- in times of conflict or disagreement, the entire team should be consulted
- while making decisions, the sides will make proposals and the team will vote (majority wins)
- if a team member is failing to deliver on their obligations, they will first get a verbal warning/discussion before approaching the professor(?????)
- during (working hours decided by team), members are expected to answer within 2 hours
- messages sent outside those hours should be responded to at the beginning on the next work day
## Sprint Details
- sprints will take 1-2 weeks depending on the tasks decided by the product owner
## Daily Standup
- standups will occur (days) from (times)
- all members are expected to attend
- members will not cover for others who are misisng
- members who make no progress on a task for two stand ups or more in a row will be reported to management
## Coding Standards
- (need to pick a code editor/linter)
- make small commits
- start simple with code (to get it working), before iterating
- push working code, and if your code breaks the build, fix it
- write descriptive commit messages
- write self documenting code (good variable and function names)
- get rid of dead/commented out code
write automated tests to cover integration points and functionality

# Git Workflow

# Contribution Rules and Considerations
## Rules
1. When your tasks overlap with someone else's, be sure to communicate to avoid redundancy
2. If blocked, let the scrum master know or update the team during the next stand up
3. Get work started in a timely manner, as to avoid last minute issues
## How to Contribute
- when coding, continuously make commits so that issues can be identified and caught early
## What to Contribute
- work on tasks given to you by the scrum master
- if details are unclear, ask so that contrbutions are exactly as expected
