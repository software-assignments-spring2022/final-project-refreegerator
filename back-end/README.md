## Building
- `npm install` will install all the dependencies
- `npm start` will start the server
- `npx nodemon start` is another way to start the server. This will start up the server without requiring you to stop and restart the server whenever the code is changed.

## Testing
This project uses mocha and chai as its testing framework and library. 
- `npx mocha test/[testname.test.js]` where testname is substituted with the name of the test.
