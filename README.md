# ReFreegerator #

## Description ##

ReFreegerator is an app that allows users to track the expiration 
of food items. After creating an account, users can add and edit
items to create a list of foods and their respective expiration
dates. From here, the app will track the foods and notify
the user when a food is close to spoiling.

## Project Vision Statement ##
[To be drafted by product owner role]

## History and Contribution ##

The items found in one's fridge come with a sell-by date,
used to indicate the period for which they're edible. As the 
number of items in one's fridge increases, it can become 
increasingly difficult to keep track of all of the various
sell-by dates, potentially leading to wasted food and money, 
should these foods begin to spoil. The ReFreegerator app
seeks to provide a convenient solution to this problem, thus 
helping
users to make the most of the items in their fridges.
